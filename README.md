# Implementation of simple non-Linear Regression Model <br/><br/>
## Dataset: GDP vs Year (China)<br/>
### Model: Since this data doesn't have test set, focus is on fitting the existing data<br/>
### Libraries used:<br/>
**Numpy** - For numpy arrays<br/>
**Matplotlib** - For plotting<br/>
**Pandas** - To read data<br/>


### Description
- Fitting the existing data is the aim of developing this model
- The sigmoidal function is used for predictive modeling
- Improvement is required in this model as well
